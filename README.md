# AndroidDevInternshipTest
This repository contains my work for the technical test for an internship position.

TODO :
This test consists of integrating graphical interfaces into a native Android mobile application. 
The templates for the graphical interfaces to be followed are attached (you must import them into the Figma software to view them). 
Download and unzip the Figma template, then create a native Android mobile project. You must integrate the graphical interfaces.
